## Meeting Description

**Date/Time:** 20/09/2023
**Meeting Number:** \#01
**Meeting Location** Online

## Meeting Agenda

| Talking Points | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| The Project Brief | SE vs Research Project? Developing model/dataset from scratch? GUI? |
| Deliverable | Real time processing? Inputs/Sensors? Camera conditions? Classifying objects? Locating Objects? Images or Videos (target fps?) (using LSTMs to encode a count over time)?  Datasets (COCO, DPSB)?|
| Ideas | Have used Keras before so would like to use that for the model. Selecting the backbone model for this project will be important and must consider the end use of the project (fps, accuracy, memory). |

## Meeting Minutes

14:05 - Introductions
14:20 - Advice on reading marking scheme
14:25 - Advice to trust the process, finish milestones by year end, polish dissertation for months and months afterwards
14:30 - Anecdote of "null hypothesis", don't panic if stuff doesn't work (A null result is a result, if process is followed)
14:35 - Dissertation advice, use overleaf and keep updating outline as it goes. Breakdown into modules akin to how a program is written.
14:45 - Brief is very relaxed.
14:50 - Presentations.
15:30 - My turn, talk about papers, too general, but in a single observation. Think of example where counting several objects in an observation.
15:35 can a netwprk learn significant concepts given what is observed in the scene, "whats there in front of you?", vision is an answering.
15:52 NAARX architectures - have a look.

## Further Notes

Unable to follow agenda as group meeting, but lots of helpful advice.
"My students tend to get high marks" - (W W W W W)
"Complete milestones by end of the calender year"
"Experimental (preliminary) results by end of year!"
"Use overleaf for ease, get it started"
Get something going as fast as I can.

Make a CV website, outside of project but very important.

## Issues Discussed / Potential Solutions

* Keep reading
* Get Started on Dissertation
* Proposed narrow view when we have 


## Action Points

### Action Point 1

* Put title into dissertation, guess titles for chapters in Overleaf.

### Action Point 2

* Fill out plan.md with initial milestones

### Action Point 3

* Get Dissertation from either Paul or Mitchell
* Get brief from Paul

### Action Point 4

* Fill out plan.md with initial milestones, bulk out as more information is gathered

### Action Point 5

* Follow process, commit more often

### Action Point 6

* Show some fascinating progress, what other people have done, what have I done, how can we combine these, scouting experiments, what's possible!?
* Have a direction where I want to take it.
