## Meeting Notes

* Ok, well my project idea has been shotdown ten weeks in, focus on the *bread and butter* mate.
* Moving into encoding spatio-temporal conitnuity.
* Networks condensing the properties of visual concepts.
* Focus on the capsule network, investigating the semantic stack.
* Classic lack of control, like Babbage in ~1820 wrote a proposal of how he could build a mechanical computer "Differential Engine". Was never completed because fall outs and tried to shoot for the stars. Ada Lovelace was able to show something proper from this project. Moral of the story, get the bread and butter working.
* Keep U-NET to side but focus on getting CapsNet working and showing some initial results.

## Action Points

### Action Point 1

* Get started on the capsule network for the 6th week in a row. please man
