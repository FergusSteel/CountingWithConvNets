* Capturing these representations in a more complex environment, to demonstrate visual concept encapsulation.

### Dataset

## Whats the plan?

* Create pilot study, using typical CNN methods, to get inital results that will help me contrast and compare. This is mainly so I can get to grips with the framework I choose (depends on capsule network implementation).
* Have a design for the capsule network for nextweek that can be implemented.
