## Meeting Description

**Date/Time:** 17/11/2023 15:00:00
**Meeting Number:** \#08 (Week 9)
**Meeting Location** Online

## Progress Made

<https://sway.office.com/uyhOf9xLEWBCyoHo>

* Pilot studied finished, capsule network research (biological motivation, dual stream architecture)


## Meeting Minutes

14:55 - My turn
15:00 - Walking through progress made, showing off pilot results
15:05 - Discussing how to use pilot results and plans to compare and contrast with neural (capsule) approach
15:10 - Gradcam
15:15 - Discussing general visual research limitations and how I can approach my reserach
15:20 - Hourglass approach, singling out aim, and then recasting problem to wider scientific space.
15:25 - Implementing Neural Modules and combining them rather than approaching it hierarchically, Like in dual stream hypothesis using capsules to represent sub processes, Where is it? / What is it? How can I model this with capsules! A localization capsule network, A classification Capsule Network
15:30 - How to approach reserach and combining theory with results 

## Meeting Notes

* Show my thinking with Gradcam rather than (or both) using latent space representation to model the attention mechanism in a Transformer?
* Be aware of how visual serach functions. understand attention mechanisms and emulating this with masks
* Vision research is often approached in the sense of a single paradigm, coming at it from a psychological perspective is great if i can combine the paradigms.
* Dual Stream Hypothesis!
    * What is it?
    * Where is it
    * Our visual system (and entire neural architecture) is made up of countless sub-processes that can combine to allow for us to complete complex actions **Instinctively**
* Combining neural processes that are encapsulated in capsule networks! (Localization Capsules) + (Classification Capsules) -> Neural Network!
* Hourglass model, come from a wide berth of research, narrow it down to a atomic idea, show it thoroughly and then expand back out
* Get some good sleep before we go crazy
* Polish in research comes from thorough and complete investigation not expansive complex ideas.

## Action Points

### Action Point 1

* Plan Research *thoroughly*

### Action Point 2

* Get something off the ground with capsules, learn what works and what doesn't work
