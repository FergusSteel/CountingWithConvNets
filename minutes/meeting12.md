## Meeting Minutes

Plan for next week:
codify
triageinto the things definitely need to be done, would like to and things to write about
know where im going and how i will get there, 
NEED DIRECTION
rank in terms of ease and value.
sit down and think about what the fuck im doing, plan it out in my head
write all this down
MAKE A MAP
include a chain of logic throughout all of dissertatoin writing.

## Said Plan

- What needs to be done?
  - The model needs to work LOL - most important
  - A quantitative intrinsic evaluation of the counting of my network, per class accuracies, mean class accuracies, count accuracy, locallity accuracy
    - Do I need per-class recall & precision?
  - Qualitative Results, a set of accurate counts to show in dissertation with visualisations.
    - A way to display these visualisations accurately rather than just in table
  - Clean code, clean outputs, log visualisations
  - Decide what parameters are variable and show analysis of them changing
- What would I ideally like to get done?
  - Introspection model
  - Investigating capsule outputs
  - Introducing error analysis - how much does rotation and scale change error of model
- What would I like to write about
  - Extrinsic evalutations, generalising "counting" capsules, why would we do this, talk class agnostic counting and benefits, potential use cases?
- Directions
  - Demonstrating that capsule networks can be adapted to count and explaining why we would want to do so.


## Talking to Paul about the plan...

NEed to read that paper I was reading this morning that talks about the grammar of capsules.

In calss variance detection, how many red stars vs how many green stars. See ID3

Measurement THeory, classification true positive and false positives

Look at it in **functional utility**

How do i demonstrate where it can go, how it all fits together
