| Talking Point 1 | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Going Forward | Are you available for weekly meetings at a scheduled time? Always online? Have a look at GitHub / Can the repo be public?|
| The Project Brief | - SE vs Research Project, I would prefer research oriented. |
| Deliverable | Real time processing? Inputs/Sensors? Classifying objects? Locating Objects? Images or Videos (target fps?) (using LSTMs to encode a count over time)?  |
| Ideas | Have used Keras before so would like to use that for the model. |
