# Plan

* Investigating the Ability of CNNs to Count Visual Concepts
* Fergus Steel
* 2542391s
* Dr. Paul Siebert

Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1** Initial Meeting, Research and Experimentation
* **Week 2** Define Direction, Setup Reference Manager, Collate Related Material, Create Related (Panoptic/Segmentation/Attention) Demonstration, Complete Milestones and Timeline
* **Week 3** Conduct Extensive Literature Review!
* **Week 4** Draft a literature review summary, identify research gaps
* **Week 5** Dataset Decisions (creating one / using one)? Preprocessing plans? Language Model? Generally Select Toolset.
* **Week 6** Collate dataset, complete preprocessing (augmentation, resizing, encoding?)
* **Week 7-10** Design CNN architecture with other architecture decisions (attention/transformer), bening implementing the CNN models and other mechanisms.
* **Week 10** Training and Testing. Optimizations (hyperparameter tweaking), Visualizations, attention maps/density maps.
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]** Probably finishing incompleted milestons + benchmark performance tables (accuracy, speeed, etc.)
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report writing and submissions.
