# Hypothesis

* Capsule Networks will increase the quality of the representations of visual concepts in Class Agnostic Counting

# What is gained from this research?

* Class-Agnostic counting theoretically allows for us to count objects in any object domain.
* Capsule Networks are a relatively new area of reserach in Artificial Intelligence, and by demonstrating their use in a novel domain, we can make a valuable contribution to the literature by expanding the use cases of CapsNets.

# How can we demonstrate this value?

* Is a Class-Agnostic Capsule Network Architecture capable of predicting the density maps of visual concepts? – **(1) representational general utility**
* Can Capsule Networks be used to count in unseen distributions/domains in Class Agnostic Counting Tasks? - **(2) representational adaptability**
* Can the use of Encapsulated Representaions improve density-map estimation in Class Agnostic Counting? – **(3) representational specific utility**


# How will we experiment this

* Building a Capsule Network that system that attempts to show the above concepts,
    * **(1)** - To do this the network must be able to create density maps on trained distributions
    * **(2)** - To do this the network must be able to create density maps on object distributions that have not been seen
    * **(3)** - To do this the network must be able to demonstrate that it is an improvement on existing seminal research
