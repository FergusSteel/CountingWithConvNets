| Demonstration of Density Map Estimation | -  |
| Directions for Proj | - Prompt-guided object counting: Combine Language models and Deep CNNS such that a model can analyse an image and the end user can then prompt the CNN to count a certain object. Allows for investigation into how the CNN "sees" the image and into how this can be manipulated by language. This idea would be more impressive if could run on video frames. i.e. "highlight 3 people in this video" and it woudl remove the masks for other people and track those 3. <br> - Visualisation attention maps in a counting task, to see how the object attends to a given object. <br> - Combining CNNs and NARX/LSTM networks to combine spatial and temporal information in crowd counting tasks, i.e. Using CCTV dataset, by incorporating temporal information can we improve the accuracy of count? Generally investigating the effect of treating videos as time series rather than individual frames in the context of Computer Vision|
