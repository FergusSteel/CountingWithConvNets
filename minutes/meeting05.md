# Meeting Minutes - 2542391s

## Meeting Description

**Date/Time:** 20/10/2023 14:00:00
**Meeting Number:** \#05
**Meeting Location** Online

## Progress Made

* Laid out research plan and figured out potential hypotheses and potential sucess factors. 
* Decided to use the FSC dataset if you think that my other idea is too simple. 

## Questions

* Should I be designing the Capsule Network from scratch, i.e. coding it myself. Or using existing implementations and extending them?
* Can I define my own success factor defintions, i.e. **representational general utility** which I define as the basic function of the model, can I use this definition.
* Where should I keep dataset? Or should i just have download instructions? Is this even marked/ will marker run my code?
* Do you think I should shoot for the stars and use FSC dataset or build a proof of concept on shape/MNIST (make my own MNIST-esque data set with complex patterns that creates multiple density maps) - thus it would then be a proof of concept if I could show that it can select only the shapes/digits provided in the exemplar?


## Meeting Minutes

14:25 - Paulius' Turn
15:00 - My turn
15:05 - Slides
15:20 - Goeduls incompleteness theorem and database relationship to capsule idea
15:45 - Investigating Counting!
15:50 - Concept of visual concepts - how encapsulatable are things.
15:55 - What can be counted? Defining and investigating counting. 

## Meeting Notes

* Contemplate relationship to databases - ER Diagrams, BIG SELLING POINT
* Explore if this idea has been explored before, using capsule as they unify hairy neural network.
* Goedul Incompleteness theorem - first order logic vs arithmetic. Isomprophism betweent two formal systems should be ab le to be solved both ways.
* I have touched on an attempt to unite formal copmutational systems.
* This project has been festering in the back of Paul's head consiering "When are things the same whena re things different"
* What are the degrees of freedom in the problem? In counting objects have the same properties, we can count them if they are sufficiently similiar"
* He wants to explore the problem. What are the bounds and limits of counting? - Explore what other people have explored in the area of counting?
* In a nutshell MNIST shows the style we want to look at
* Moving from crispy problem to general problem EXPLORE COUNTING not what im making.
