## Meeting Description

**Date/Time:** 10/10/2023 14:30:00
**Meeting Number:** \#05
**Meeting Location** In-Person

## Progress Made

* Laid out research plan and figured out potential hypotheses and potential sucess factors. 
* Decided to use the FSC dataset if you think that my other idea is too simple. 

## Questions

* Should I be designing the Capsule Network from scratch, i.e. coding it myself. Or using existing implementations and extending them?
* Can I define my own success factor defintions, i.e. **representational general utility** which I define as the basic function of the model, can I use this definition.
* Where should I keep dataset? Or should i just have download instructions? Is this even marked/ will marker run my code?
* Do you think I should shoot for the stars and use FSC dataset or build a proof of concept on shape/MNIST (make my own MNIST-esque data set with complex patterns that creates multiple density maps) - thus it would then be a proof of concept if I could show that it can select only the shapes/digits provided in the exemplar?
