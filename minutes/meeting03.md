## Work Done Prior to Meeting

### Action Points:
Emails ignored again, sent more out on thursday to try get another response
Read a lot about capsule networks, definitely something I would be interested implementing more on that later...
Read a little about cellular automota but I felt I was getting off topic so mainly focused on further computer vision research
Found several sources to lift from, started implementing demonstrations, **bricked my laptop** meaning I lost any demonstration I had to make but it was essentially just trying out implementing density map estimation at a lower level to experiment with visualising activity maps, was going to continue to add to it by adding characteristics to the Objects in the scene.
After losing all that progress went back to research papers, read a lot of the more state-of-the-art literature on Few Shot Counting which is a method for implementing class-agnostic counting, by supplying a model with exampler images i.e. examples of what you need to count in the scence. This has been built on with Zero Shot Counting this year which uses GAN to generate these exemplars from the prompts. The exemplars typically are supplied as bounding boxes but this incroporates a lot of noise as this is done at feature level, so one direction this reserach could go is to implement CapsuleNetworks as they don't have pooling layers.
